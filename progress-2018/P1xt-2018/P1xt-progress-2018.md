# P1xt - 2018

My dual main goals are to A) study algorithms in depth and B) explore Physics. To that end, I am including a variety of Computer Science, Mathematics and Physics courses, with no prescribed order. I'll just select the next course in whatever list I'm most inspired to continue each time I'm ready to progress to a new course. (I've selected all three MITOCW lists from the course-paths, and I'll be hopping between them willy-nilly.)

**Note:** All of my notes, exercises, etc are in [the Progress pdf file](progress/progress.pdf) instead of broken out into separate markdown files - because GitHub still hasn't joined us in this century and enabled MathJax in markdown and I didn't feel like migrating the whole shebang to GitLab the first time I wanted to take some notes that involved an equation. So all my notes are in latex and everything is bundled up into that pdf so I'll have one big "yes, I did this" document at the end of the year.
